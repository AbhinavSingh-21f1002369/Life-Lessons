## The power of Compounding in relationships, busineses, money can really change the trajectory of your Life.

Use the power of compounding to help gain momentum in changing your life around. Take help from whosoever people you can and never feel shy to ask. For what seems studpid to you might be a good topic to talk about for another person.
I've observed in past few months that rich people don't like to talk about themselves when they talk to you, they want to know about you, they want you to ask them questions. This makes them feel good, and as a reult your relationship with them will improve. Thus this relationship compounding over the years will definitely prove to be life changing one.
 The gist is use the power of compounding to your advantage. Go out of the way to help people sometimes as well, you never know how it may compoound.
